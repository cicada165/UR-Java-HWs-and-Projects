Project1
Extra Credit:
1.We add some randomness to the sentences generated.
We create four arrays to select from them.


After the instruction the player enters "go" to start the game.
The height and the distance are randomly generated between 1-20.
Players will be informed of the distance and height.
We used percent difference to determine how close the user get instead of using actual value. We made this decsion 
because say the random generated height is 3 and the user hit 1. It is within three and should belong to "not quite over"
However, smaller heights are normally easier and hitting a height of 1 in 3 is quite bad. The percent difference makes the
difficulty of the game in pace with the actual height.
Then they will be aksed to iput a distance and a height.
Programm will compute whether the projectile make it over the wall.
Then there will be two scenarios:
A. If the projectile makes it over the wall
The player has the option to continue the game or quit.

B. If the projectile doesn't make it over the wall
The player has the option to :
1.Try again with the same distance and height.
2.Skip this round and start with new distance and height.
3.Quit the game.

Players will be informed of their score at the end of each try and when they quit the game.
